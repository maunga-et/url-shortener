This is a url shortener web application. The program accepts a url from a user then it generates a unique ID. After generating the unique ID the program returns a link which can be used by the user. If the user is a registered user with the platform the user can see the number of visits of the url which has been generated by the program. If the user is not registered on the platform they cannot see the number of clicks on their site but they can share the generated link with others.
